Modified application from **[mini-project 1](https://github.com/mbednarek98/School-Projects/blob/master/SMB/SMB1)** in such a way that instead of a local database, it uses a remote one (e.g. Firebase Realtime Database, Google Cloud Firestore or another) to store data on products on the shopping list (storing options is not mandatory).

## Requirements

- Frontend application managing the shopping list.

- Application/backend part (if required by the chosen solution) for managing data on purchases on the side of the selected cloud platform.

- User authentication
    - User should have the possibility to access and modify their own list of products as well as shared ones.
