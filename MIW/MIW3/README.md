Python code for data analysis and visualization using decision trees and random forests. The code also plots the accuracy and confusion matrix for each model.

## Requirements

1. Split the data set into training and test subsets;

2. Check the performance of the tree for entropy and Gini coefficient - compare the results and justify the outcomes;

3. Check the performance of the tree for different tree depths - compare the results and justify the outcomes;

4. Check the performance of random forests for different numbers of decision trees - compare the results and justify the outcomes.
