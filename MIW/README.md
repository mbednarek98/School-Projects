This repo contains projects on various topics of machine intelligence. The projects use Python to implement different models and algorithms, such as Markov chains, perceptrons, logistic regression, trees, forests, neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and autoencoders. The projects also involve data analysis and visualization.
