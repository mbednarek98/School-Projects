Modified Python code from mini-project 6 for an autoencoder using CNNs. The code uses MNIST and shows the input, encoded, and output images.

## Requirements

1. Expand the convolutional network from project 6 to an autoencoder, by removing the classification layers and adding symmetric Conv2DTranspose layers. Adapt the network to use mnist data (Handwritten digits); 

2. Train the model using only input data, the model output is equal to its input; 

3. Present on test data how the input data, data returned by the encoder and output data look like.
