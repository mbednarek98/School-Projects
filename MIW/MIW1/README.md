Python program that uses a Markov chain model to learn and play rock, paper, scissors. It updates the transition matrix after each round and plots the cash balance.

## Requirements

1. Write a program that learns to play “rock, paper, scissors”. As a learning algorithm, use a Markov chain with a transition matrix between three states (Paper, Rock, Scissors). Learning the game consists of correcting the transition matrix (conditional probabilities of state change); 

2. Payoff value: 1 in case of win, -1 in case of loss and 0 in case of draw;

3. Conduct a series of several dozen games of “rock, paper, scissors”. Make a graph of how the cash balance changes at each step of the game;
