Prolog code for map representation and navigation. The code uses spatial concepts and relations, and allows dynamic facts. The code also demonstrates Prolog features.

## Requirements

1. Prepare a map of the apartment or its part (e.g. room, room with corridor). Mark the existing furniture, appliances, etc. on the map. 

2. Propose a language that describes the situation on the plan (choice of facts). 

3. Propose a definition of spatial concepts describing spatial relations, e.g. between, next to, on, etc. 

4. Introduce dynamic elements that allow adding new or changing existing facts. 

5. Propose navigation rules that allow moving in the described space. Perform a specific navigation task - e.g. moving close to the TV. 

6. Elements that should be included in the project: 
    - terms, complex terms (facts), 
    - clauses (definitions of new concepts),
    - dynamic elements (adding and deleting terms during program execution), 
    - recursion, 
    - unification, cut, 
    - lists (operations on lists).
