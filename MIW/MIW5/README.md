Python code for image classification using CNNs. The code uses CIFAR10, trains a classifier for two classes, and compares different network architectures.

## Requirements

1. For the data “CIFAR10 small image classification” from the Keras library, propose and implement a division of these data into training and test data; 

2. Based on a convolutional network, according to the instructor’s guidelines, propose a classifier that classifies two out of ten classes;

3. Propose a classifier with one, two, and three convolutional layers; 

4. Compare the results from the previous point and propose an optimal classifier for the given problem.
