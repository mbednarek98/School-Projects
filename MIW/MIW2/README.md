Python code for multi-class classifiers using perceptrons or logistic regression. The code also prints class probabilities for logistic regression.

## Requirements
1. Using perceptrons, write a multi-class classifier (classifying 3 or more classes). For each class, use a binary classifier. An example of a binary classifier is given below.

2. Write a multi-class classifier using logistic regression. For each class, use a binary classifier. An example of logistic regression for the two-class case is given below.

3. For logistic regression, write a method that prints the probability of belonging to a given class (classes) for a sample (samples).
