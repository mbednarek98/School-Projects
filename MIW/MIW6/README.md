Python code for crypto price prediction using AR and RNN. The code fits and compares two models without LSTM layer.

## Requirements

1. For the stock market quotations of cryptocurrency, propose and implement a division of these data into training and test data;

2. Propose a linear autoregressive model (AR model) taking into account several previous quotations (no more than 50). Determine the model parameters using the least squares method. Verify the correctness of the model;

3. Propose a recurrent neural network for predicting quotations. Train the network (use known techniques for training networks such as dropout, scaling, etc.). Verify the correctness of the model, (**DONE WITHOUT USING THE RECURRENT LAYER LSTM**) 

4. Use additional available data for predicting quotations; 

5. Compare AR and recurrent neural network models.
