Python code for linear and quadratic regression using least squares. The code also evaluates and compares the models.

## Requirements

1. Load the data from the file daneXX.txt. Propose and implement a division of these data into training and test data; 

2. Propose a linear parametric model Model 1. Determine the model parameters using the least squares method for training data;

3. Verify the correctness of Model 1;

4. Propose a more complex parametric model Model 2. Determine the model parameters using the least squares method for training data; 

5. Verify the correctness of Model 2;  

6. Compare both models.
