Application that aims to manage your income and expenses.

## Requirements

- Screen of income and expenses list: 

    - Screen will display a list of expenses and income incurred. For each entry, information with the name of the place related to the expense/income (e.g. Biedronka, Multikino, PJATK), the amount entry, date and category it relates to (e.g. food, health, fees, entertainment etc.). 
    - Screen should contain a summary of expenses/income from the current month (sum of entries)

- Screen for adding/editing an entry - it starts as a result of clicking the button adding or in case of editing an existing entry on the list. 
    - This screen allows you to assign/change the data of the entry and contains a button saving changes/entered data.
