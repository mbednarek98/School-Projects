Application that aims to document your travels around the world.

## Requirements

Create an app that will help you document your travels around the world. The app should allow you to take a picture, on which a caption will be applied containing the name of the town and country where the picture was taken and the date. The user should be able to add a short note < 500 characters to the picture. 

Pictures should be stored in the app internal memory, and the notes in the local database. The app should offer the possibility of browsing the pictures, and after selecting a given picture, the note added to it should be displayed. 

Add a mechanism that will check if the user is within 1 km of the location where the picture was taken. If so, they should receive a notification about this situation with the possibility of viewing the picture and reading the note. 

App should also have a settings screen, where the user can change the color/size of the caption on the picture and the radius of the circle of action of notifications (default 1 km).
