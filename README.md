<h1>School Projects</h1>
</div>

This repo contains projects related to various topics and technologies that I learned at PJATK. The projects are smaller in scale and scope, so they are grouped together in this repo instead of having their own separate repos. The topics and technologies include Android development, data analysis, machine learning and more.

<h2> Machine Learning and Data Analysis Projects </h2>

<h3> Methods of Knowledge Engineering </h3>
</div>

Contains projects on various topics of machine intelligence. The projects use Python to implement different models and algorithms, such as Markov chains, perceptrons, logistic regression, trees, forests, neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and autoencoders. The projects also involve data analysis and visualization.
